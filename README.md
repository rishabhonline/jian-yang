#  Jian Yang: Hotdog Identifying App 🌭
Jin Yang, "What would you say if I told you there is an app on the market .." when he gets interrupted by Erlich.
Lucky that I have no Erlich to interrupt me.
# Why This App?
While it might seem trivial, the reason why I decided to do this mini project which took me less than one night to complete is that often, Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers have a very good performing model. However, due to lack of presenattion skills, the project ends up getting boring. Unless you have a good web developer things might get a little tricky if jsut AI engineers were to sit and code front end web interfaces which obviously is not their job.

[Streamlit’s](https://www.streamlit.io/) open-source app framework  is  the easiest way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to create beautiful, performant apps in only a few hours! All in pure Python. All for free. Isn't open-soure the best! 

# Dependecy and Environment
Install using Anaconda

    conda env create -f jian_yang.yml

# Run the App

    streamlit run hello.py
